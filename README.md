# Pi2Fly
Primary Flight Display (PFD) based on Python and OpenGL with the hardware implemented on a Raspberry Pi.
The project was supposed to show the viability of using off-the-shelf low-cost components to achieve useable sensor accuracy and reliability.
This was done by using multiple sensors of the same kind to achieve redundancy and the ability to average sensor readings.
